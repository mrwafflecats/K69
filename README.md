# K69
69 key handwired keyboard 

Basically a 65% keyboard with a split backspace.

Has stl files for a case and two plates; one with a normal layout and one with a stepped CAPS lock. The plates are 5 mm thick and will accomodate both plate mount and pcb mount stabilizers

There are also dxf files if you want to create your own plate or keyboard with this layout.
